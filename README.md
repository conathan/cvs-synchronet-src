# cvs-synchronet-src

This fork is meant to add password hashing support to Synchronet.

Unlike other projects I have worked on, this was mostly "blindly" looking for uses of LEN_PASS (vs understanding the full structure of Synchronet) to try to identify places where the password was used (and adjust accordingly), so probably has major issues with it.

Anyway a work in progress.
